# Lagom/IBM Integration Examples

[Lagom](https://www.lagomframework.com/) is a framework for developing reactive microservices in Java or Scala. Created by [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com/), Lagom is built on the proven [Akka](http://akka.io/) toolkit and [Play Framework](https://playframework.com/), and provides a highly productive, guided path for creating responsive, resilient, elastic, message-driven applications.

This repository contains examples of integrating Lagom services with a variety of technologies provided by IBM, including:

- [WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/websphere-liberty/)
- [IBM Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/)
- [IBM Message Hub](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/message-hub/)
- [IBM Db2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/db2/)
- [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/cloud-object-storage)

## Examples

Each example is contained in its own directory within this project, and includes a detailed "README.md" file with instructions for running them:

- [Lagom integration with IBM Message Hub](lagom-message-hub-example/)
- [Lagom integration with IBM Message Hub and WebSphere Liberty](lagom-message-hub-liberty-integration-example/)
- [Lagom integration with IBM Db2 and JPA](lagom-jpa-db2-example/)
- [Lagom integration with IBM Cloud Object Storage](lagom-cloud-object-storage-example/)


This set of examples will grow over time as new integrations are developed.
